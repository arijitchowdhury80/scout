# Build Log - Scout Product Launch Checkpoint

Date: 2026-06-28
Status: Checkpoint verified, not product-launch complete

## Scope Built

- Competitor website research baseline under `docs/competetor-website-knowledge/`.
- Scout private-beta website foundation under `website/`, using the
  Supadesign IndustrialGray design system.
- Generic product export adapters for JSON, JSONL, CSV, and SQLite.
- CLI command `scout product-export`.
- Hosted-readiness primitives:
  - API key generation, hashing, masking, and usability checks.
  - Hosted plan and credit policy definitions.
  - Hosted URL safety / SSRF validation helpers.
- Workspace planning docs for hosted readiness, launch website, and product
  export adapters.

## Verification Run

Commands run from `/Users/arijitchowdhury/Dropbox/AI-Development/Scout`.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/core/platform tests/unit/core/products tests/unit/cli/test_run_commands.py -q
```

Result: `116 passed, 8 warnings`.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -q
```

Result: `428 passed, 8 warnings`.

```bash
python3 -m pyright scout/
```

Result: `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations`.

```bash
ruff check scout/ tests/
ruff format --check scout/ tests/
```

Result: `All checks passed!` and `180 files already formatted`.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8766 --directory website
```

Then a Python Playwright Chromium check validated:

- desktop viewport `1440x1000`
- mobile viewport `390x844`
- hero heading visible
- `#why`, `#evidence`, `#pricing`, `#quickstart`, and `#beta` sections present
- 14 links present
- no browser console messages

Screenshots were written to ignored local output:

- `validation-output/website-scout-launch/desktop.png`
- `validation-output/website-scout-launch/mobile.png`

## Not Complete Yet

This checkpoint does not finish the full launch objective. Remaining work:

- Hosted multi-tenant persistence and API-key management endpoints.
- Hosted quota middleware, Stripe checkout, and webhook handling.
- Deployment architecture and infrastructure.
- Local distribution package validation across install paths.
- Full product website beyond one static landing page.
- Current competitor/pricing research refresh before public launch.
- Legal/license review for Crawl4AI attribution and distribution posture.
- Broader live feature certification before making public product claims.
