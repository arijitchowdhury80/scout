Introducing web-scale /monitor - always-on search that pings your agent the moment something comes online. [Read the docs →](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/monitoring-web-scale?utm_source=firecrawl-web&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=web-scale-monitor-launch)
Changelog
Jul 1, 2026
## Web-scale /monitor
Web-scale `/monitor` watches the entire web for you. Define search queries and a goal, and Firecrawl pings you or your agent the moment something new comes online.
###  Highlights
  * **Always-on web search** — Give `/monitor` search queries and a `goal`, and it searches the entire web on your schedule, alerting you when something new matches.
  * **Tune recall and precision** — `queries` control what each search pulls in, while `goal` decides which of those results actually alert.
  * **Webhook or email delivery** — Get pinged the moment something new matches, with a plain-English explanation of why it matters.
  * **One endpoint replaces the DIY stack** — Define your query once. Firecrawl handles the search, deduplication, filtering, and alerts.

## v2.11.0 is live
Firecrawl v2.11.0 ships the Firecrawl Research Index, keyless endpoint access, automatic PII redaction, a `deterministicJson` format, and video discovery on any page - plus much more.
###  Highlights
  * **Firecrawl Research Index** — Search across 3M+ arXiv papers and the GitHub code behind them (issues, merged PRs, and READMEs, refreshed daily), fetch a paper's details or related work, and check claims against full text. It has state-of-the-art recall on arXivQA, outperforming the next best provider by 18% at comparable cost.
  * **Keyless access for core endpoints** — Use `/scrape`, `/search`, `/interact`, and `/parse` without an API key from official MCP, CLI, and SDK clients.
  * **Automatic PII redaction** — A new `redactPII` option strips personal and sensitive data like names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and secrets out of scraped content before it's returned.
  * **`deterministicJson`format** — Get structured JSON without running an LLM on every request. Firecrawl generates a reusable extractor for your schema and caches it per site, so repeat scrapes are cheaper and return consistent results.
  * **Video discovery on any page** — The `video` format now finds videos on any page, not just supported providers like YouTube, returning each video's URL, title, thumbnail, duration, and more.

## Firecrawl Research Index
Firecrawl Research Index is a specialized index for agents pushing the frontier of AI/ML research. It has state-of-the-art recall on arXivQA, outperforming the next best provider by 18% at comparable cost.
###  Highlights
  * **Benchmark-leading performance** — On arXivQA, the index hits 53.3% recall versus 45.4% for the next best provider. The index also scores 0.750 MRR, putting the right paper in the top one or two results.
  * **Search millions of papers alongside their code** — The index includes 3M+ arXiv papers, plus GitHub artifacts from top research repos (issues, merged PRs, READMEs), refreshed daily.
  * **A complete toolset for research loops** — Agents can retrieve papers, verify claims against full text, and pull code, going from literature to implementation with no manual review.
  * **Plugs into any agent harness** — Works with Codex, Claude Code, Grok Build, and more.

May 26, 2026
## Introducing /monitor
Enter a URL, describe what you want to track, and `/monitor` notifies your AI agent via webhook the moment pages or sites change. Use up to 90% fewer LLM tokens by only ingesting what actually changes.
###  Highlights
  * **Set a goal in plain English** — Describe what to watch, like "alert me when the Claude Code docs add new slash commands," and `/monitor` configures the URLs, schema, and schedule for you.
  * **Up to 90% fewer LLM tokens** — Your agent only ingests what changes on a page, skipping unchanged content and noisy diffs.
  * **Any cadence, with cost upfront** — 5 minutes, hourly, daily, or a custom cron schedule. The estimated monthly cost is shown before you turn a monitor on, so you know what you're committing to.
  * **Webhook or email delivery** — Every change fires a signed webhook with custom headers and per-event subscriptions, or arrives by email with the diff in the body.
  * **Permalinks for every change** — Diffs are first-class objects you can share with a teammate or hand straight to another agent.

May 15, 2026
## v2.10 is live
Firecrawl v2.10 ships a new `/parse` endpoint, Lockdown Mode, Question and Highlights formats, and four new official SDKs (Go, Ruby, PHP, .NET) - plus a long list of reliability and security fixes.
###  Highlights
  * **`/parse`endpoint** — Upload PDFs, Word docs, and spreadsheets up to 50 MB and get clean, LLM-ready Markdown, JSON, or summaries back. Powered by a new Rust-based engine that's up to 5x faster.
  * **Lockdown Mode** — Set `lockdown: true` on `/scrape` to serve results exclusively from Firecrawl's index with no outbound requests and zero data retention by default. Available everywhere, including the CLI (`--lockdown`) and MCP.
  * **Question Format** — Pass a natural-language prompt to `/scrape` and get a grounded answer back, with up to 100x fewer tokens per call.
  * **Highlights Format** — Get back the exact sentences, code blocks, and table rows on a page that match your query, with original formatting preserved — also using up to 100x fewer tokens per call.
  * **Four New Official SDKs** — Go, Ruby, PHP (with Laravel support), and .NET all joined the SDK family with v2 parity. The Rust SDK has been promoted to the official v2 SDK.


Read the full changelog [here](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/releases/tag/v2.10).
May 8, 2026
## Highlights Format
**Highlights** is a new format for `/scrape` that returns the exact sentences, code blocks, and table rows on a page that match your query, all while using up to 100x fewer tokens.
###  Highlights
  * **Citable, hallucination-free output** — Nothing in the response is rewritten, translated, or hallucinated. Every sentence is provably from the source page, in the page's own words.
  * **Code blocks and tables preserved** — Consecutive sentences from the same block re-join into paragraphs, consecutive code lines wrap in fenced blocks with their original language, and table rows rebuild into Markdown tables with headers auto-included.
  * **Up to 100x fewer tokens per call** — Returning just the matching lines instead of the full page lowers inference costs, speeds up responses, and keeps your context window lean.


Read the full documentation [here](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape?utm_source=changelog&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=highlights_format_launch#highlights-format).
See the benchmark [here](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/question-format-launch?utm_source=changelog&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=highlights_format_launch#highlights-focus-benchmark).
May 6, 2026
## Question Format
**Question** is a format for `/scrape` that returns high-quality, grounded answers from any web page using up to 100x fewer tokens.
###  Highlights
  * **High-quality, grounded answers** — `question` pulls the page content most relevant to your prompt and answers strictly from it, with zero hallucinations.
  * **Up to 100x fewer tokens per call** — `question` returns just the answer, not the page, giving you significantly lower inference costs, faster responses, and a leaner agent context window on every request.
  * **Built for AI agents** — Skip the scrape-parse-prompt pipeline. Drop precise, page-grounded answers straight into agent loops with a single call.
  * **Fully managed LLM stack** — `question` runs on a managed model chain with automatic fallback and a production-tuned system prompt. Token usage and cost roll into the same billing surface as `/scrape`.
  * **Hardened against prompt injection** — Page content is isolated with XML tagging and zero-width-space escaping, and the model is instructed to ignore any instructions embedded in the page.


Read the full documentation [here](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape?utm_source=changelog&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=question_format_launch#question-format).
Apr 30, 2026
## Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode is a cache-only option for `/scrape` that keeps security-sensitive requests inside Firecrawl. Set `lockdown: true` to serve results exclusively from Firecrawl's index, with zero data retention by default.
###  Highlights
  * **No outbound request** - Lockdown serves results from Firecrawl's index only and gates every outbound path, including HTTP and robots.txt.
  * **Zero data retention by default** - URLs aren't persisted, response data isn't stored, and the scrape job is cleaned up after delivery.
  * **One flag, every surface** - `lockdown: true` works the same across the API, every SDK (Python, Node, Go, Rust, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Elixir), the CLI (`--lockdown`), and MCP.

Apr 28, 2026
## Introducing /parse
The `/parse` endpoint turns documents into clean, structured data for AI agents and RAG pipelines. Powered by a new Rust-based engine that's up to 5x faster, it works across PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, and more.
###  Highlights
  * **Clean, LLM-ready output** — Get back Markdown, JSON, or a summary, with tables and reading order preserved. No post-processing required.
  * **Rust-based engine** — A high-performance Rust core delivers up to 5x faster parsing, cutting latency in document ingestion and embedding workflows.
  * **Zero Data Retention support** — Enterprise plans with ZDR enabled ensure parsed output is never stored, so data from contracts, medical records, and internal reports stays secure.
  * **Upload files up to 50 MB** — Supports PDF, DOCX, DOC, ODT, RTF, XLSX, XLS, and HTML.


View the full documentation [here](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/parse).
Apr 16, 2026
## Introducing web-agent
Firecrawl `web-agent` is an open framework for building AI agents that search, scrape, and interact with the web. Powered by the same architecture behind our `/agent` endpoint.
###  Highlights
  * **Bring any model** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or your own. You control the logic, tools, and infra.
  * **One command, full stack** — `$ firecrawl create agent` gives you `/scrape`, `/search`, and `/interact` in a plan-act loop, parallel sub-agents for concurrent research, and your choice of Streaming UI, API server, or library templates.
  * **Teachable by design** — Add Skill playbooks and your agent learns reusable routines. Paginate e-commerce sites, run multi-source research, and extract structured data your way.


Start building [here](https://github.com/firecrawl/web-agent).
Apr 14, 2026
## Introducing Fire-PDF
**Fire-PDF** is a Rust-based parsing engine that converts any PDF - scanned, text-based, or mixed - into structured markdown, up to 5x faster.
###  Highlights
  * **5x Faster** — Our open-source Rust library [pdf-inspector](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector) classifies each page in milliseconds and picks the fastest extraction path. Pages are processed in under 400ms on average.
  * **Layout-Aware Accuracy** — A neural document layout model detects tables, formulas, text blocks, and headers individually. Tables get full markdown output, formulas are preserved in LaTeX, and reading order is predicted neurally.
  * **Zero Configuration** — Every PDF sent through Firecrawl's API now goes through Fire-PDF automatically.

Apr 10, 2026
## v2.9.0 is live
Firecrawl v2.9.0 includes browser interaction via `/interact`, new scrape formats, smarter PDF handling, two new SDKs, and a long list of reliability fixes.
###  Highlights
  * **Browser Interaction via`/interact`** — Scrape a page, then call `/interact` to click buttons, fill forms, navigate, or extract dynamic content. Use natural language or write Playwright / Bash code for full control. Sessions persist across calls with live view URLs and reusable browser profiles.
  * **Question Format** — Pass a natural-language prompt to `/scrape` and get a direct answer back in `data.answer`.
  * **Audio Format** — Request audio output from any scrape, returned as a field on the document.
  * **`onlyCleanContent`Parameter** — Strip navigation, ads, cookie banners, and other non-semantic content from markdown output in a single flag.
  * **PDF Parsing Modes** — Choose `fast`, `auto`, or `ocr` parsing with a `maxPages` option for fine-grained extraction control.
  * **Java & Elixir SDKs** — Official SDKs with full v2 API support, joining JS, Python, Go, and Rust.


Read the full changelog [here](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/releases/tag/v2.9.0).
Mar 25, 2026
## Introducing /interact - Scrape and Automate Actions With Agents
Scrape any page, then let your agent dive deeper into what it finds. The new **`/interact`endpoint** turns any scrape into a live browser session where your agent can click, type, and navigate - all in natural language.
###  Highlights
  * **Natural Language Control** - Describe what you want in plain English. The agent clicks, types, scrolls, and extracts data automatically. No selectors, no scripts.
  * **Live Browser Sessions** - Every session includes a live URL you can embed, share, or interact with in real time. Build browser-powered UIs, debug visually, or demo workflows.
  * **Persistent Profiles** - Log in once and pick up wherever you left off. Cookies, localStorage, and session state carry across scrapes with named profiles - no re-authenticating, no lost state.
  * **Full Playwright Control** - Need precision? Switch to code mode and run Playwright (Node.js or Python) or Bash with [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) in the same session.
  * **Session Reuse** - Chain multiple interact calls on the same scrape. The browser stays open and maintains state between calls, so complex multi-step workflows just work.


View the full documentation [here](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/interact).
Mar 12, 2026
## Firecrawl Java SDK
Full support for our core endpoints, including scrape, search, and crawl. Works with Maven, Gradle, Java 17+.

## Faster, Smarter PDF Parsing
Our new PDF parsing engine delivers **3x faster parsing** and significantly improved reliability.
Rebuilt in Rust, it automatically adapts to any PDF - from clean text files to scanned reports and complex layouts - ensuring agents receive complete, accurate data every time.
###  Highlights
  * **Rust-Based Parser** - A new high-performance engine built in Rust delivers up to 3x faster parsing, dramatically reducing latency in data ingestion and embedding workflows.
  * **Three Parsing Modes** - Choose the right balance of speed and completeness: 
    * `fast` - text-only parsing with the Rust engine for maximum performance.
    * `auto` - the new default; starts in fast mode and automatically falls back to OCR when needed. Auto intelligently detects when PDFs require OCR even if they appear text-based, handling edge cases like embedded images, graphs, multi-column layouts, and unusual text encodings.
    * `ocr` - forces OCR parsing for fully image-based or scanned documents.
  * **Built for Production Reliability** - Extensively tested across thousands of real-world PDFs to ensure consistent, accurate extraction in production environments.

##  /extract changes
We have updated the `/extract` endpoint to now be asynchronous. When you make a request to `/extract`, it will return an ID that you can use to check the status of your extract job. If you are using our SDKs, there are no changes required to your code, but please make sure to update the SDKs to the latest versions as soon as possible.
For those using the API directly, we have made it backwards compatible. However, you have 10 days to update your implementation to the new asynchronous model.
For more details about the parameters, refer to the docs sent to you.

##  Introducing Actions
Interact with pages before extracting data, unlocking more data from every site!
Firecrawl now allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.
  * Version 1.5.x of the Node SDK now supports type-safe Actions.
  * Actions are now available in the REST API and Python SDK (no version bumps required!).


Here is a python example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.
```
from firecrawl import Firecrawl
app = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")
# Scrape a website:
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev',
    params={
        'formats': ['markdown', 'html'],
        'actions': [
"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
